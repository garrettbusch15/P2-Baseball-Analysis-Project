    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball has long been considered America's pasttime.  It's hard to argue with considering the continued success, world intrigue, baseball coliseum's and the oh-so unforgetable comfort food. Looking past these inviting activities, your left with a game, just a game. This game, for the most part, has been played almost exactly the same way for 100+ years. 1 of the major reasons baseball has remained the same (aside from some mound changes, strikezone variation, baseball technology)  is because of the prevalence of statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In today's game, we have what are called saber-metrics that look to compare anything from  offensive prowess to defensive efficiency to pitcher accuracy & pitch selection.  In this project we will engineer our own metric for offensive ability as we work with a dataset that is geared toward traditional baseball data points (Hit, At Bat, Home Run, etc.). The purpose of this project is to provide a logical data analysis project that ultimately seeks to help answer questions I pose.\n",

    "Let's get started.\n",

    "## Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of individual and team performance, what were some of the  greatest disparities from an individuals season vs. the next best on the team? (an unequivocal MVP)\n",
    "\n",
    "What players, over the course of their careers, had constantly faced the above matched environment?\n",
    "[See answer](#question1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Did the above scenario's have any show any interesting trends when it comes to individual end-of-season awards?\n",
    "\n",
    "How did team's fare that matched this particular condition? Can a player truly \"carry\" the whole team?\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from comparing individual vs. team how did players born from \"warm\" weather states fare in comparison to those that wern't?\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Verify and checking data\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we'd like to take an initial dive into the data either to identify holes, anomolies, etc.. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need to import some initial libraries."
