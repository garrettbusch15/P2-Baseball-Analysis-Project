    "# P2 Project Submission\n",
    "### By Garrett Busch \n",
    "### Apr 2017\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Baseball has long been considered America's pasttime.  It's hard to argue with considering the continued success, world intrigue, baseball coliseum's and the oh-so unforgetable comfort food. Looking past these inviting activities, your left with a game, just a game. This game, for the most part, has been played almost exactly the same way for 100+ years. 1 of the major reasons baseball has remained the same (aside from some mound changes, strikezone variation, baseball technology)  is because of the prevalence of statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In today's game, we have what are called saber-metrics that look to compare anything from  offensive prowess to defensive efficiency to pitcher accuracy & pitch selection.  In this project we will engineer our own metric for offensive ability (relatively simplistic at that) as we work with a dataset that is geared toward traditional baseball data points (Hit, At Bat, Home Run, etc.). The purpose of this project is to provide a logical data analysis project that ultimately seeks to help answer questions I pose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions to be answered\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of individual and team performance, what were some of the  greatest disparities from an individuals season vs. the next best on the team? (an unequivocal MVP)\n",
    "[See answer](#question1)\n",
    "\n",
    "What players, over the course of their careers, had constantly faced the above matched environment?\n",
    "[See answer](#question2)\n",
    "\n",
    "How often was the MVP winner the leader in this statistic?\n",
    "[See answer](#question3)\n",
    "\n",
    "How did team's fare that matched this particular condition? Can a player truly \"carry\" the whole team?\n",
    "[See answer](#question4)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Noteable considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Because data is being summarized on a season level, any analysis, will have to be calculated at this level and because of this we risk favor/unfavoring: rookie seasons, injured seasons, etc. In the case of valuing a players offensive contribution the previously mentioned will undoubtedly discount a players total contribution as they may have not been available or present in order to contribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources used\n",
    "\n",
    "Python docs https://docs.python.org/3/\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Verify and checking data\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, we'd like to take an initial dive into the data either to identify holes, anomolies, etc.. \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll need to import some initial libraries."

The next player on the list, Albert Pujols, may go down as one of the greatest players of all-time when his career is over. On one hand, Albert's place on this list is supported by the superiority of his offensive numbers but also because of the lack of a truly defined 'partner', of which, he was able to share the offensive load.
